## Fraud detection prediction using Machine Learning algorithms

Fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning in financial services, where the goal is to identify fraudulent transactions or activities. We'll go through the steps needed to develop a fraud detection model using machine learning, focusing on the following steps:

1. Data Understanding and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Deployment

Since you mentioned wanting to plot distributions of numerical features, I'll start with data exploration and visualization as part of the fraud detection project.

## Step-by-Step Guide
Data Understanding and Exploration

## 1. Load the dataset.
Generate summary statistics.
Visualize distributions of numerical features.
Analyze correlations between features.
## 2. Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize/Standardize numerical features if necessary.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Create new features based on domain knowledge.
Select important features using methods like feature importance from tree-based models or correlation analysis.
## 4. Model Building
fro this project of fraud detection there is only four column need are as followes
## Splitting of dependent and independent variable are as :
x = df[['type','amount','oldbalanceOrg','newbalanceOrig']]
y =df.iloc[:,-2]
Choose and train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
Perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.
## 5. Model Evaluation

Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.
Analyze confusion matrix to understand model performance.
## 6. Model Deployment

Save the trained model.
Deploy the model for real-time or batch prediction.

## Conclusion: 
Upon training and evaluating our classification model, we found that the Random Forest model performed the best by a narrow margin.Random Forest: Achieved the best overall performance with a balance of accuracy and robustness to overfitting.

This project demonstrates the importance of a systematic approach to fraud detection, combining statistical analysis with machine learning techniques.

## To determine if the implemented actions are working effectively, the following steps and metrics should be utilized:

A/B Testing
Performance Metrics
User Feedback
